# Operatprs in python

# 1. Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, / etc. 
# 2. Assignment operators:  =, +=, -= etc. 
# 3. Comparison operators: ==, >, >=, <,  != etc. 
# 4. Logical operators: and, or, not. 

# 2. Arithmetic Operator

a = 6
b = 2   
c = a + b
print(c)

# # Assignment Operatotr

a = 4-2 # Assign 4-2 in a
b = 6
print(b)
b += 3 # Increment the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)
b -= 3 # Decrement the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)
b *= 3 # Multiply the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)
b /= 3 # Divide the value of b by 3 and then assign it to b
print(b)


# # Comparision Operators ( There retun value is always Boolean)

d = 5<4
print(d)

# print("Hasnain" == "Hasnain")

print(5>4)
print(5<=5)
print(5!=2) # 5 is not equal to 2
print(5!=5)


# Logical Operator

e = True or False
print(e)
