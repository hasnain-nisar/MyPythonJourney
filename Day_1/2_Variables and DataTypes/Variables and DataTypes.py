# Variables and Data Types


# Rules for choosing an identifier.

# A variable name can contain alphabets, digits and underscores.
abc = 11
a_2 = 121
a_b_c = 1123
_a = 1212121

# a@b = 111 # Cannot use this

# a!b = 11122 # Cannot use this

# A variable name can only start with an alphabets and underscores. A variable name cannot start with digit.

# 1a = 12 This is not correct.

# No while space is allowed to be used inside a variable name

# Practice set of Chapter 2

# Write a python programme to find a reminder when number is divided by z

# a = int(input('Enter number a: '))
# b = int(input('Enter number b: '))

# print('Reminder when a is divided by b is ', a % b) # % is modulo operator, and gives reminder when two numbers are divided.


# Check the type of variable assigned using input () function. 

# a = input('Enter the value of a: ')
# print(type(a))

# a = int(input('Enter number a: '))
# b = int(input('Enter number b: '))
# print('a is greater then b is ', a>b)

# Write a python programme to find the average of 2 numbers enter by user.

# a = int(input('Enter number a: '))
# b = int(input('Enter number b: '))
# print('Average of a and b is ', (a+b)/2)

# # Write a python programme to find the square of a number enterd by the user.
# a = int(input('Enter number a: '))
# print('Square of a is ', a**2) # Instead of ^ python use ** for powers
# print('Square of a is ', a*a)
# print('Square of a is ', a^2) # This is not valid in python. Incorrect for finding square in python.
